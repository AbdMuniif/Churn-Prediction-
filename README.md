Machine Learning Pipeline Design to Predict Churning in 2 years 
==============================
This project is a churn prediction pipeline that includes a prototype for user testing. 
It leverages three machine learning modelsâ€”Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network. The best-performing model is integrated into the prototype for user testing. The prototype, built with Gradio, provides an interactive interface for testing and improving the model's performance.

Directory Structure
-------------------
- `Dataset` Dataset used in the project.
- `logistic_regression_model.pkl` The best-performing model selected for integration into the prototype.
- `training_columns.pkl` The list of feature columns used for training the model.
- `ChurnPrediction` Python code of data training, model development, and experimentation.
- `app.py` Python script for the Gradio user interface or testing.

Installation
------------
Make sure to install the necessary libraries and modules before running the project.
